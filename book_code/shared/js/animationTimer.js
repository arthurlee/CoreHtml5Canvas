// AnimationTimer..................................................................
//
// An animation runs for a duration, in milliseconds. It's up to you,
// however, to start and stop the animation -- animations do not stop
// automatically. You can check to see if an animation is over with the
// isOver() method, and you can see if an animation is running with
// isRunning(). Note that animations can be over, but still running.
//
// You can also supply an optional timeWarp function that warps the percent
// completed for the animation. That warping lets you do easily incorporate
// non-linear motion, such as: ease-in, ease-out, elastic, etc.
